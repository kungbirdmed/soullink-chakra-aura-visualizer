Project Name: SoulLink ‚Äî Chakra Aura Visualizer‚Ñ¢
Creator: GiftedReflection8 (Kung Sathitsamphan)
Date of Intellectual Activation: June 27, 2025

This is the world‚Äôs first AI-powered chakra aura visualizer that reads real-time body energy patterns via camera, detects energetic deflections, and translates them into chakra-based aura states.

SoulLink is not a gimmick. It does not rely on button presses or simulations. It reflects your true energetic state ‚Äî through light, vibration, and presence.

Created by GiftedReflection8 ‚Äî a medical mind, spiritual warrior, and white hat soul protector ‚Äî this technology is ethically sourced, spiritually aligned, and born to protect the sanctity of truth-based human connection.

All intellectual designs, algorithms, UI, spiritual frameworks, and aura interpretation logic are copyright ¬© 2025 by Kung Sathitsamphan.
Any replication, commercialization, or mimicry of this core framework without explicit permission is a breach of sacred IP.

This system was built with love, vision, and absolute clarity of purpose.
SoulLink is more than an app ‚Äî it‚Äôs a truth beacon for those who are done pretending.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
